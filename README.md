# Semantic segmentation with spherical CNNs

This repository contains the semantic segmentation code for spherical CNNs used in *Equivariance versus Augmentation for Spherical Images* [1].

The implementation is based on the original S2CNN code, available [here](https://github.com/jonkhler/s2cnn), from which this repo is forked. This repositiory adds the following to the S2CNN code:

- A new equivariant convolutional layer `SO3ToS2` which takes feature maps on SO(3) as input and outputs feature maps on SÂ².
- Some simple example code in `examples/mnist_sem_seg/` for generating semantic masks for the spherical MNIST digits and training equivariant and non-equivariant networks on this dataset. For details see the `README.md` in that directory.
- Some minor modifications of the original S2CNN code to make it compatible with PyTorch 1.8.1.

More details on the `SO3ToS2` layer, the semantic segmentation dataset and the network architectures implemented here are given in [1].
